# KNN

- KNN is based on the calculation of Euclidean Distance between test sample and training sample in order to find the most similar data points around this test sample point, which can be found by looking at its 'k' nearest neighbours.

- The class present in the majority among these k nearest neighbours will be the test sample's predicted class.

- Based on the similarity measure.

- As a thumb rule, always standardize the data as this classifier is based on the calcualtion of Euclidean Distance, which will be affected by data present on different scales, and not on a same scale.
